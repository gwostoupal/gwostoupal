<h3>About Me</h3>
  
<h5>Hello, I'm a second-year PhD student in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology program at Seattle Pacific University. My general research interest is personnel selection. My specific interests include asessement methods, individual differences, and advanced technologies and how they impact equal opportunity, applicant perceptions, and hiring decisions. Currently, I serve as the lead graduate research assistant on a qualitative study examining the challenges that prompt Christian middle managers to draw on their faith at work. I am also part of the SIOP Strategic Taskforce where we analyze qualitative and quantitative membership data to inform SIOP’s future 3-5 year strategic plan. I am eager to dive more into my passion of personnel selection through research and applied opportunities!<h5>
